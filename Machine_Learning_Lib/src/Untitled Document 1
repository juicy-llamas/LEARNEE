Machine Learning (Learnee) Notes

( this is like the API / just me typing to get my head straight )

OK so first thing to know is that all the code is in a namespace ( Learnee ), so you call functions/create classes like this:

	Learnee::Network net = new Learnee::Network( layers_object );

	double b = Learnee::Sigmoid( 3.4 );

ALL NEURON INPUTS AND OUTPUTS ARE EITHER FLOATS OR INTEGERS ( wherever it makes the most sense ).

Second thing is the matrix class
	- Matricies are gonna be private, but you can access them publicly.
